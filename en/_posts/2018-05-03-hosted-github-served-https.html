<p>U<span class="restcap">p until now</span>, the website &ndash;including the present blog&ndash; had been served by CloudFlare, which acted as a frontend to the files hosted over on GitHub. Esentially, this setup made it possible to offer the website over HTTPS, with almost all of its well-known advantages, but it also came with some issues. First and foremost, it required CloudFlare to be trusted, which kind of defeats the purpose of secure connections. <span class="sentsides"><span class="sentside">Furthermore, it had some impact on the site's loading speed, due to the way CloudFlare works</span><span class="sentside">a way to get around that was to enable <abbr>HTML</abbr> caching, but that made updating the site's pages rather cumbersome</span>.</span> Finally, it made it impossible to take advantage of GitHub's own <abbr>CDN</abbr>, instead forcing me to make use of CloudFlare's.</p>

<p>Well, as of this day, those issues are no more, for <a rel="external" href="https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/">GitHub now supports HTTPS on custom domains</a>. This feature was introduced a couple of days ago and it works flawlessly, with the only caveat that <code>CNAME</code>, the file telling GitHub Pages that the site is to be reached through a custom domain, had to be removed and added again in order to trigger the certificate issuing process. <span class="sentsides"><span class="sentside">This might be necessary for others as well, in which case it ought to be better documented</span><span class="sentside">it was not easy for me to find that out</span>.</span> Leaving that aside, everything went well; readers can now enjoy a slightly better experience and I, a simpler setup.</p>
