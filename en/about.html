<p>I am <a href="/en/home">David</a> and this is my blog, where I write about logic, knowledge, morals, politics, programming, history, typo&shy;graphy and a multi&shy;tude of other topics that inte&shy;rest or bother me. I also post short stories, poems and answers to reader's letters concerning texts I have published or am working on.</p>
<!--<p>I write in Spanish, English and German. Some topics are and will remain exclusive to one language — for example, I only write literature and poetry in Spanish, whereas technical topics are usually treated in English. Under some circumstances, I might consider translating specific posts into other languages, but such cases will always be an exception and not the rule.</p>-->

<p>The blog is built on HTML and CSS code I wrote myself, using Jekyll and Sass to put everything together. The sources can be found in <a rel="external" href="https://www.github.com/kalrish/blog">the repository</a>.</p>
