<p>I<span class="restcap">t is somewhat hard</span>, after focusing on the implementation and taking care of every detail &ndash;no matter how tiny&ndash;, to come up with content with which to start filling an otherwise empty, albeit beautiful, design. Indeed, what should the very first post mention and explain?</p>

<p>The answer to that question probably depends, on the one hand, on the motives which impel to advance the blog, and, on the other hand, on the objectives pursued in doing so, if any. Should there be specific reasons or goals behind the project not subject to change in the course of its development, it could well be better to detail them in an <i>About</i> page. It is when, on the contrary, the motivation fluctuates and no specific goals are pursued, when the content is dynamic in nature and not subject to a very strict classification from the start, that taking care of the necessary explanations in regular posts starts making sense.</p>
<p>Now, that's not actually my case, for I know well what I will write about and why. <span class="sentsides"><span class="sentside">This fact notwithstanding, I haven't yet considered, as profoundly as I like to ponder every question which occupies my mind, how such motives and reasons shall be explained</span><span class="sentside">and yet, it is necessary to test the just-uploaded system with a post</span></span>. Let it be the present one.</p>
